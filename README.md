This is my TodoList Website build with HTML,Bootstrap and Django. Here are two pages such as “index” and “task”. “index” form is connected with the Django Backend and a SQLite database where a user can input the required information in the index form and send the response to the backend. Then we used an ORM query to fetch the data from the database and represent it on the Tasks page using Django Templating.
